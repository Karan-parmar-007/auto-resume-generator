This is one of the project which I have build while I was learning django.

I have just created a basic template, and not much, It dosent loot that much impressive but it is great  for building basic resume.

If I update this project in the near future than i will be updating this file aswell

for currently running this you need to do this:

1. install django (my version is 5.0.1)
2. install mysqlclient
3. create a new folder and place all the folder and files inside it.

Hope this is helpfull.
